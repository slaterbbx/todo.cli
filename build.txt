------------- EXAMPLE GLOBAL PROJECT LIST BUILD FILE -------------

// builds innitial global list from $todo init <buildfile>
// the "global" list can be used to handle unordered project lists that do not -
// directly need to be associated with a file of the project.

# Global list title example
    - item 1 of this list
    x finished item on this list
    * stared list item ( wont delete when --purge )
        # Next list title ( list attached to a list item )
            - example of list item 1
            - example of list item 2
# List Title Example
    - List item example
        - attached list item to list item example
        & /images/img.png



// builds starter project with injected list items from <buildfile>
// these can be used for project "boilerplates"


------------- KEYS -------------

* = starred list item ( does not delete when --purge command run )
# = ID' list group "Title"
- = list item ( incomplete )
x = list item ( complete )
& = file attachment
>> = import external files
% = code attachment // code attachments can be viewed via CLI and GUI version of the app
*& = create file in designated location with designated file name, or even clone a page from git
<|> = code injection: inject code from files into newly generated projects

------------- EXAMPLE PROJECT BUILD FILE -------------
---- NOTE: you can also build a list from the CMD / Terminal then build a project from that list
---- TERMINAL LIST VIEW: terminal view will be similar to the following of a list, with the exeption -
---- of commands as follows:
--- CMD's ---
-- $todo -l -a project
-- $todo -l -a global ( this is a default "floating" list, and can be attached to file notes / todo list items )
-- $todo -l -a ( assumes all lists with all possible / visible fields )
-- $todo -l -a custom list
-- $todo -l ( assumes all / with "closed" lists and "hidden" lists both closed and hidden )
