// Task identifiers
// 3d4A | four digits
// Task identifiers look like the following when used in a file on a task
// |-| 3d4A | this is an example todo list item in my file

// The goal of task identifiers is to be synced up with the live backend service, this allows -
// teams / team members to take on the role of handling a task by assiging a task id from their -
// account, team leaders can also use this to assign tasks to team members / show investors instant response
// ---- Task identifiers will also work in static mode, ie. local file system with git only if "non tech savy -
// team members / investors" are not apart of the equation on your project
// ---- in static mode, user uses CLI to generate an ID for themselves, puts it in the file -
// uploads to git and other users can run a command to see the name of the person who has -
// taken on the role of handling that todo list item, this info will be kept in a .tskids file in the project

// A "Fully loaded" todo list item might look like the following
// |x| 3d4A | FIREBASE | setup connection to firebase, edit users id based on api changes
